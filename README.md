# Quartermaster - an inventory management application

This application is a basic inventory management system running on Supabase and Material UI on top of a typical React/Nodejs base.

This project started out in TypeScript. But the decision to use Material UI as a component library caused me to consider reverting to standard React/JavaScript. While it is possible to use Material UI with TypeScript, it is "tricky" as the MUI docs themselves describe it. The workarounds required add to the amount of boilerplate code required and code complexity, to say nothing of developer time :). Furthermore, the MUI components themselves are written in TS and provide some of the type saftey benefits of using TS in this project.
